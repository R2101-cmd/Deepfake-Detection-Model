# 🧠 Deepfake Detection Model

This repository contains a deep learning–based model for detecting deepfake videos and images.  
The goal is to identify manipulated facial content using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Overview

Deepfakes are synthetic media where a person’s likeness is replaced or altered using AI techniques.  
This project aims to build a **robust detection system** capable of distinguishing real from fake faces with high accuracy.
